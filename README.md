# broadwayDesign
In the project, I employed properties like display and position to enhance the layout of the landing page for Broadway Design, a fictional design firm. The existing site had some initial style rules, which I leveraged to revamp the positioning of the navigation menu and the supporting sections (Design, Develop, Deploy) beneath the image.
